# 🎓 Alumni Connect Platform 

## 📌 Abstract

Every year, hundreds of graduates complete their education and pursue diverse career paths. Building and maintaining strong alumni relations is crucial in exposing students to a broader range of resources and opportunities. This web-based platform aims to bridge the gap between students and alumni by offering a centralized portal that enables:

- Alumni registration and profile management  
- Job, internship, and mentorship postings  
- Student access to alumni experiences and opportunities  
- Event registration and participation  
- Search and filtering of alumni based on job, location, education, etc.

The system consists of three major modules: **Admin**, **Alumni**, and **Student** — each tailored to serve specific functionalities.
